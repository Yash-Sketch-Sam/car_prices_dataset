## Business Understanding for Vehicle Sales and Market Trends Project
## Objective:
The aim of this project is to analyze sales transactions of used vehicles and identify key market trends that can assist stakeholders such as automotive dealerships, buyers, and financial institutions in making informed business decisions. Specifically, the project seeks to provide insights into vehicle pricing, condition, mileage, and market values, offering a comprehensive understanding of the factors that influence vehicle sales and pricing fluctuations.

## Key Business Questions:
.What factors influence the selling price of used vehicles?
This question helps dealerships understand which attributes—such as the condition, make, model, mileage, or year—have the most impact on vehicle prices.

.How do vehicle condition and odometer readings affect pricing?
Analyzing how the condition rating and mileage of vehicles influence their market value allows for better price estimations and trend predictions.

.What are the current market trends in terms of vehicle demand and pricing fluctuations?
Understanding market trends is vital for pricing strategies and aligning inventory with customer demand.

.Can we build a predictive model for vehicle prices?
Developing a model based on vehicle attributes and market data will provide valuable insights for forecasting future prices, aiding buyers and sellers in making timely decisions.

## Importance of the Project:
Dealerships: Better inventory management by understanding what types of vehicles sell more quickly and at higher prices.

Buyers: Helping consumers identify which vehicles provide the best value for money based on condition and market trends.

Financial Institutions: More accurate vehicle value assessments, which are critical for setting loan amounts and insurance policies.
By answering these business questions, the project will deliver actionable insights to various stakeholders, leading to better decision-making in the automotive sales industry.
